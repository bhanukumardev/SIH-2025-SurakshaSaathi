## üö¢ Deployment

### Database Configuration

The application uses a flexible database system:

- **Development**: Uses SQLite via `better-sqlite3` for local development  
- **Production/Serverless**: Automatically falls back to JSON file storage when SQLite is unavailable

This ensures the application works seamlessly in serverless environments like Vercel where native modules may not be available.

### Vercel Deployment

- Set `NODE_ENV=production` in `.env`  
- The build system automatically handles the SQLite fallback
- JSON storage is used for user data and alerts in serverless environments
- Plug-and-play with Vercel for static + API serverless deploy  
- Docker Ready (see Dockerfile)  

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --only=production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
